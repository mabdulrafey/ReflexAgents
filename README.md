# ReflexAgents
This project simulates the behavior of different types of reflex agents in a room-cleaning scenario. The agents are designed to perceive their environment (room state) and perform specific actions based on the perceived conditions. There are two types of agents implemented: the Goal-Based Reflex Agent and the Simple Reflex Agent.
